* Web 

1. Warmup 

- Access the url given in the challenge description will bring you to the login page and we need the password to get through of it.

- Without source code, the first thing that come to my mind is inspect the code and find some intresting things. 

- While inspecting, You wil see a few  `javasript` file, within all the file, the `/static/script.min.js` seem intresting since we can detect that there are some functions that has been obsufucated.

- Using online javascript deobfuscate tool to deobsufucate the `javascript`  to make the code more readable. 

- Between the `javascript`function, you will the aunthetication function that also containt the password to login. `Pass : `

- Using the `Pass`, we managed to login to the site but still not get the flag. It is say that the flag is in comment but when we inspect we got nothing so must do something. 

- fast foward, in the url `h**p://warmup.wargames.my/api/4aa22934982f984b8a0438b701e8dec8.php?x=flag_for_warmup.php`, the `x` value look like can be exploit.

- First things first i try with the `dot slash` payloads to try the vulnerable : `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and yup the servers responses exactly like we want, it return the value/content of the `/etc/passwd`. so that mean it is legit vulnerable to the `LFI/Path Travesal` Vuln.

- But since i dont know the flag location, others `dot slash` payloads is useless, After a minute searching through the internet i found a various `LFI` payloads on [github](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/File%20Inclusion/README.md#lfi--rfi-using-wrappers), thanks to the respo owner
