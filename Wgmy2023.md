1. Warmup 

- Access the url given in the challenge description will bring you to the login page and we need the password to get through of it.

- Without source code, the first thing that come to my mind is inspect the code and find some intresting things. 

- While inspecting, You wil see a few  `javasript` file, within all the file, the `/static/script.min.js` seem intresting since we can detect that there are some functions that has been obsufucated.

- Using online javascript deobfuscate tool to deobsufucate the `javascript`  to make the code more readable. 

- Between the `javascript`function, you will the aunthetication function that also containt the password to login. Yeay !! `Pass : `
