* For this challenge, for me, the hint provided is not so usefull since that not even lead to the flag.
  
* But another things that attract me is the text "find out that he uses a well known social network and and loves documenting his travels and reviewing his food. Find his online profile".
  
* Social network? Profile?. This is the absolutely hint that we need. Social network is social media, and most of people will share their adventure or anything on twitter or instagram. And profile here must mean that the user profile inside the social network. Nice! Let start OSINT-it.
  
* Inside the challenge description also provided the name which is "Jonnah Explore", so like try to find that username, luckily for me, i found the profile with exaclly the name on tiwtter.
  
* Click the profile and view the post. Boom here is the flag!

* Download the image provided : Chicago.jpeg

* In this challenge, it ask us to find in which hotel does jonnah stay. Now, in this challenge is the hint provided is usefull, When you translate "joy" to Italy, you will get "Gioia". Fyi, there is a italian restaurant in west loop chicago called "Gioia Chicago".

* So the first thing that come to my mind is, the hotel where Jonnah stay must be near with the restaurant location, with this, it help to make the job scope smaller.

* Open the image provided.
