**[Category] Web**

1. Warmup [Disclaimer : `Im not main in web therefore if got some miss lead explaination here pls forgive me :)`]

- Access the url given in the challenge description will bring you to the login page and we need the password to get through of it.

- Without source code, the first thing that come to my mind is inspect the code and find some intresting things. 

- While inspecting, You wil see a few  `javasript` file, within all the file, the `/static/script.min.js` seem intresting since we can detect that there are some functions that has been obsufucated.

- Using online javascript deobfuscate tool to deobsufucate the `javascript`  to make the code more readable. 

- Between the `javascript`function, you will the aunthetication function that also containt the password to login. `Pass : `

- Using the `Pass`, we managed to login to the site but still not get the flag. It is say that the flag is in comment but when we inspect we got nothing, we have to do something. 

- fast foward, in the url `h**p://warmup.wargames.my/api/4aa22934982f984b8a0438b701e8dec8.php?x=flag_for_warmup.php`, the `x` value look like can be exploit maybe with `LFI/Path Traversal` Vuln.

- First things first i try with the `dot slash` payloads to test the vulnerable : `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and yup the servers responses exactly like we want, it return the value/content of the `/etc/passwd`. so that mean it is legit vulnerable to the `LFI/Path Travesal` Vuln.

- But since i dont know the flag location, others `dot slash` payloads is useless, After a minute searching through the internet i found a various `LFI` payloads on [github](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/File%20Inclusion/README.md#lfi--rfi-using-wrappers), thanks to the respo owner

- Using any of the `LFI payloads` such `php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=`, `php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-encode/resource=`, the servers will detect the `string` and `convert`and came out with an error `did you just mention "convert"?? i'm quitting now`, so this mean that the word `string` and `convert` has already been filtered  by the servers so that the payloads could not be use.

- therfore what we gonna do is we gonna encode the word to url encode = `convert = %2563%256f%256e%2576%2565%2572%2574`, so the payload will be like this `x=php://filter/%2563%256f%256e%2576%2565%2572%2574.base64-encode/resource=flag_for_warmup.php`, using this encoded payload we successfully bypass the filter.

- Using the payload, the servers will responses by giving us `Base64` strings, using `cyberchef` to decode and and yup we got the flag.

**[Category] Forensic**

1. Compromised

- Download the zip file given in the challenge `evidence.zip` and unzip it.

- There a few directories inside the file `AppData,Desktop,etc...`

- Inside `Desktop` directory, there is a `flag.png` file, when we try to open it, it say cant be open due to it is not a `png` file, run on `file` command, the `flag.png` file is a `zip` file, rename it to `flag.zip` and unzip it. while unzip the zip file, it ask for the `password`.

- That is the main event for this chall, which is to find the zip file `password`.

- Fast Foward, inside `AppData` --> `local` --> `Microsoft` --> `Terminal Client Server` --> `Cache`, we found an intresting file which is `Cache0000.bin` file.

- Using [BMC tools](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools), i extracted all the files inside the `Cache0000.bin`, as a result we extracted 2000++ of file from the `.bin` files.

- Lookin at the extracted files. we can see that, all of them is a `.bmp` images file, and we can see the image is like puzzle, where we have to combined them to find the password. and yup after combined them we retrieve the pass `WGMY_P4ssw0rd_N0t_V3ry_H4rd!!!`

- Using the pass to unzip the `flag.zip` and earn the `flag`.
